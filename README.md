Bluetooth Remote Control Car.
4 3.7V batteries power the motors through a L289N driver.
The motors are 3-6 V, so I connected the ones on the left and on the right in series to get enough current.
HC05 Bluetooth Module.
2 Ultrasonic Distance Sensors.
Accelerometer (haven't used it yet).
I used a separate source for the Arduino (9v battery) because the voltage fluctuated too much when the motors were on and the Bluetooth connection wasn't stable.

I created the phone app on MIT App Inventor.
